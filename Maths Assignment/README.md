# Matrix Row Reduction to Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF)
ðŸ“˜ **Assignment Overview:** <br>
This Python script is designed to read a matrix from a file, perform elementary row operations to reduce it to its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF), and then provide the solution in parametric vector form.

ðŸ“‚ **Files:**
- `matrixinput.txt`: This file contains the input matrix. The format of the file is as follows:
The first line specifies the number of rows in the matrix.
The second line specifies the number of columns in the matrix.
The subsequent lines contain the elements of the matrix row-wise.
- `matrix_rref.py`: This is the Python script that reads the matrix from the file, performs row operations, and outputs the RREF of the matrix along with the general solution in parametric vector form.
dsem`: Contains materials related to the midterm examination.

ðŸ“Œ **Important:**
Please make sure to follow the guidelines and policies outlined by the institution regarding the use of shared coursework materials. Use this repository responsibly and avoid any violations of academic integrity. Solutions are provided for reference purposes only. It's recommended to understand the solutions and implement them independently.
